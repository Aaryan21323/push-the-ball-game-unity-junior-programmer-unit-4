This project was developed as part of Unity Learn’s Junior Programmer – Unit 4.
The unit emphasizes analyzing and fixing existing code, debugging errors, and improving overall gameplay behavior.
In addition to gameplay improvements, a simple UI was implemented to support player interaction and game flow.
This project serves as hands-on practice in problem-solving, code analysis, and Unity UI implementation.
